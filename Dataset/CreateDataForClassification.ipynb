On Sunday (04/08/2019) we had paid and booked for a tyre to be fitted on Wednesday (07/08/2019)We had been given the option of an AM or PM booking (no time specific) We chose an AM booking. Tuesday evening came an email at 17.31 saying there had been a delay on the tyre and they needed to reschedule to Friday. This was no good to us as we needed it fitting Thursday at the latest due to a long drive. The option to call them straight away wasn't there, as their offices close at 17.30 coincidentally! Called them first thing Wednesday AM, my partner stressed that a fitting for Friday was not possible and Thursday would be the latest we could have it done.After speaking to the woman on the phone for 10 minutes and a few back and forth phone calls later, she agreed to have a fitter come out and fit the tyre on Thursday (AM) email confirmation received stating AM delivey/fitting.Thursday 11:30am and the fitter still hadn't arrived. My partner rang [REDACTED] and she said that an AM booking is anywhere between 9AM &1PM. 1:30PM and the fitter still hadn't arrived. She waited an hour and rang [REDACTED] back, after a few back and forth phonecalls they said the fitter was stuck in traffic, and possibly wouldn't be able to get to her till after 5PM.My partner suggested they came to our house after 5pm as this really needed doing and we had aleady been let down 3 times, [REDACTED] gave us the number of the fitter so we could contact him.5:15PM and still no sign of the fitter at home. My partner decides to ring the number that was provided.The fitter said that [REDACTED] should of told us that he wouldn't be able to get to us till tomorrow morning now.My partner said it needed to be done today. He said he would get in touch with a fitter and get back to us. 7:12 and we still haven't heard anything from anyone. My partner tried calling [REDACTED], but their offices are now shut.

It therefore came as a shock to experience really poor service on this occassion.Everything seemed fine at first, my order went though and I was looking forward to having two reasonably priced tyres fitted at a convenient time on a Saturday morning. Later that day I received an email to say the garage could not fit my tyres on the Saturday, that was slightly annoying but OK, I replied to the email to say their suggested fitting day of the following Tuesday would be fine.The next day I receive an email saying they can't deliver my tyres to the garage for the following Tuesday, bearing in mind that it's only Friday at this point and if so why was it even suggested to me as a possible fitting date. Their new suggested day wasn't convenient and I was beginning to feel messed around so I replied saying it was becoming slightly ridiculous now and that I'd have to make alternative arrangements so please cancel the order. Three days later and I still had not received a response or order cancellation from them. I sent an email suggesting rather sternly that they get their act together and cancel/refund my order. It was another day, nearly a wek after the initial order that it was finally cancelled. There was no apology, no explanation, nothing in their email.I really am confused as to why [REDACTED] would think I should use them again or reccommend them to friends or family.

I replied and asked them to look at other garages in the area as I needed them fitted that weekend. About an hour later I received a follow up email telling me it was too late for them to deliver the tires to any other garage for the following afternoon and that the next available appointment was now Wednesday! I asked for my money to be refunded and figured I would just book myself in with a local garage instead as they had plenty of spaces to do the fitting when i needed it. Heard nothing back and no refund which meant I couldn't book in at the local garage instead. Followed up on the Monday to the customer service department and again heard nothing back. I ended up having to send an email to a different department, along with a complaint which resulted in my payment being refunded.

The only reason I’ve given them 4 stars is due to how difficult it is to reach their customer services, by email only in my experience which goes to a central mailbox, once it’s there you are dealt with - not necessarily with the same person throughout the query and it took a couple of days to settle my query with emails going back and forth - but it does get sorted. But in my experience you just can’t get through over the phone which for me was just a little frustrating and meant my query settlement took days instead of being sorted in one phone call. But the prices are great and my local fitting centre was absolutely brilliant.': [0,\n",

Money taken on the 2nd. On the 6th I get an email at 15:45 that there is an issue with delivery and I need to rearrange the fitting time and day. As I don't constantly look at my emails I only saw this mail after 6pm when I could not phone them. Phone them the next day, waited 10 minutes before I was answered and apologised to me saying that I can get them fitted on Friday at the same time as my Wednesday appointment had been. Friday comes and I get to the fitter who tells me that they have only had 3 tyres delivered of the 4 I ordered and paid for. I ended up having the three fitted and left the best one of the previous 4 on. I phoned them whilst I was at the fitter. They apologised again and said that they will refund the 4th tyre, Give me £20 off and also a 10% voucher for when next I use them. Of course that was just to fob me off and I only received the refund for the tyre. Not a happy customer and will rather pay more per tyre at another provider than get messed around by this rather unimpressive outfit.\": [1,\n",

I have also never had any problems when I have attended one of their many fitting partners - also have the option for the fitters to come to the customer for a reasonable £6 extra charge - I’ve never used that option so can’t comment on its quality. Out of curiosity I asked the recent fitting centre I had used how much the tyre supply and fitmeant would cost if I bought the tyre from them.

I entered my registration and was shown the tyres that were supposedly suitable for my car. I was looking for the same Bridgestone S001 run flat tyres. The S001 tyres appeared at the top of the search results and seemed a good price. I ordered them. Instantly I got an email from [REDACTED] saying they think I have ordered the wrong tyres and they ones I ordered were non run flats and my car would have run flats. Looking at the website again the correct tyres were 4 pages down in the search results and a total of £65 more expensive. Clearly the system knew at the time of checkout that I had potentially the wrong tyres as I got an automated email from them only once I had placed an order!! Trapped why not ask at the time of checkout!!! Had to pay the extra money which then took the total price to more than other quotes I had received.Then onto the fitting. The garage is only a few mins from my house. Booked for 8am on a Saturday. Arrived 7:50am. It then took 1 hour 45 mins to fit 2 tyres. Not impressed. Then when I drove away after that long wait my car warned me that the pressure in the drivers rear tyre was too low. It had about 10 psi less than the rest! So either the garage did not put enough in or the tyre was leaking air. Went back to the garage to get it checked out. No leak just not enough air put in (very dangerous). Drove away a second time to see that this time the same tyre still did not have enough air in it to match the rest of the tyres. I ended up going to a petrol garage and fixing the issue myself with the air pump. Small point also was that my alloys and tyres were absolutely covered in the white tyre lub. You expect some but the alloy was smothered in it. So had to take the car to the cleaners also.So in summary questionable buying process and a terrible fitting experience.': [1,\n",

I replied saying noone let me know anything and I'm still awaiting for the appointment to be rescheduled. Guess what? No reply again. The next morning I decided I'm not going to deal with them via email any more, and just headed (without an appointment) to the garage in question and asked if they had received my tyres (they had).

I was desperate to get some tyres for the next day after picking up a puncture on the Thursday and having a weekend trip leaving on the Friday night and it's amazing how hard it is to get decent sport tyres for the next day as no-one carries stock. I'd first tried making a booking with Kwik Fit mobile fittings, they rejected it halfway through the booking process but then charged me for it and it took a week to get my money back. The only other place I could find was [REDACTED].com - they were offering good sport tyres next day at a very reasonable price to be fitted at the local HiQ garage. It seemed too good to be true, HiQ themselves charged more money and couldn't do it till the next Tuesday yet [REDACTED] could get the tyres to them for the next day for a cheaper price. The reviews looked good so I took my chances and it was all smooth sailing. The appointment was first thing the next morning, tyres arrived no problem and by 10am the job was done. It does seem a very good service that puts the major tyre shops like National to shame who can only get tyres to their centres in 2-3 days, plus the price is very good, so I will certainly look to [REDACTED].com again in the future.\": [1,\n",

However, I made a massive mistake in choosing McConechy\\'s, Sighthill, Edinburgh as the nominated tyre fitters. It is clear that as a [REDACTED] customer and not an actual McConechy\\'s customer appearing at their workplace wanting your tyres fitted, you are in actual fact an annoyance to them and you are getting in their way.McConechy\\'s fitted my tyres (although I\\'m very sure reluctantly).Upon being told by the tyre fitter that my car was now ready to go, I walked up to the car and noticed that there was no dustcaps fitted and had to request that 2 new dustcaps be fitted. I then left after being handed my tyre fitting paperwork.A day later I was checking the air pressures of my new tyres and then also noticed that McConechy\\'s had not even changed the valve stems either. I contacted McConechy\\'s about this and it was the tyre fitter that done the work that answered the phone. I told him that I noticed they had not changed the valve stems. I got this pathetic excuse about my existing valve stems being metal ones and he did not think I would have wanted rubber valve stems fitted, so he did not bother to change them and as an afterthought he stated \"but I changed the valve cores though\".I don\\'t believe a word of that, what the tyre fitter guy doesn\\'t know, is that I\\'m a fully qualified engineer and I know corner cutting when I see it. Remember I had to actually request that they fit dustcaps. Unfortunately I didn\\'t notice McConechy\\'s had not changed the valve stems at that time or I would have pulled them up right there and then.I know why he didn\\'t change the valve stems, it is because they are all rusted up, badly corroded and might take a bit longer to remove and change over, maybe even some other problems that\\'s why they were not changed and not his BS story about them being metal.I paid for 2 new tyres fitted and balanced with new valve stems and new valves fitted. That is not what I got.I got 2 new tyres fitted and balanced without new valve stems and a story that I don\\'t believe about the valve cores being changed.But that makes it OK doesn\\'t it ? NO, it certainly doesn\\'t !Also states on the tyre fitting paperwork that the wheel nuts were torqued to 110nm. Well when I checked them 50 miles later, the wheel nuts were all at very different torque levels, the locking wheel nuts being the tightest by far.I do not believe for 1 second that the wheels were even torqued in the first place, more like slammed back on and racked up with the air gun. There is no way the wheel nuts seen a toque wrench. The McConechy\\'s tyre fitter was/is a story telling corner cutter. Avoid them, you are not a McConechy\\'s customer, you are an annoyance to them, you are getting in their way. Not at all happy with any of this.Steven Dryden.': [1,\n",

I received an apologetic email and a voicemail outside of office hours at 5.35pm Monday, that stated the tyres would not arrive Tuesday but Wednesday instead. Contacted [REDACTED] on the phoneline on Thursday PM after realising that we had not yet had a delivery. The call handler explained that there had been a courier issue and that the tyres could not be supplied until the following Monday, 7 days after initial order. They were apologetic that I had not been contacted but couldn't offer an explanation as to why I was not informed that delivery would be delayed. Although the call handler was apologetic, it was explained that these tyres were for a client vehicle and had caused a delay in it being returned to the customer. I was offered 10% discount on next order, which I did not accept. As a gesture of goodwill it is lovely but doesn't help with the current issue & let down client. I have now sourced the tyres elsewhere, which have been delivered on Friday (today). It has taken 13mins on hold at peak time to cancel the order, (please change the on hold music :) !) but credit to both call handlers who chased the order, courier, and cancelled the order.

       " \"Booked the tyres to be fitted by a mobile tyre fitter at my home as I wanted to keep the tyres already on the car. The first appointment was missed as the tyres hadn't arrived in stock in time. This was very frustrating as I wanted the new tyres for a road trip I was taking to Scotland. We arranged to have the tyres fitted the following Saturday AM. At 11 o'clock that morning I received a call from the tyre fitters saying they hadn't received tyres from [REDACTED] (not true) and could they fit them tomorrow morning instead (Sunday). I said yes. The next day the tyre fitters didn't show up and I received no call whatsoever. I called them at around 4:45pm. They said they had broken down on the motorway and were going to call me that evening? I spoke to [REDACTED] who were deeply apologetic and arranged for the tyres to be fitted the following Saturday. I asked them not to use the same mobile tyre fitter as I didn't trust them but they did. The following Saturday arrived and once again, no one showed. I called [REDACTED] who called the tyre fitters. Once again the tyre fitters said they wouldn't be able to get to me and asked if they could come on Sunday again instead. Obviously I told them where to go. In the end we agreed that a local fitter to me would fit the tyres this Saturday. I went there and all appeared well. However when I collected the car some of the lacquer from two front wheels had been scuffed off! The tyre fitters came up with the reasons why but didn't actually apologise or accept blame. They said they will have a look at it this Friday. It's fair to say I have now given in. To be fair, throughout this whole situation, [REDACTED] customer service has actually been very good, especially from their call centre staff, and they have compensated me at each missed appointment. The problem is that there is a big issue with the tyre fitters they use/in general and I would not recommend whatsoever, having your tyres mobile fitted in the Leeds/Bradford area as this is the only mobile tyre fitter [REDACTED] use.\": [1,\n",

One of the reasons I chose [REDACTED], is that they offer Saturday fitting so it doesn't affect my working week. Got to fitters, which was only 15-20 minutes away, showed my order & they got started on it within 10-15 minutes. The staff at the garage were very friendly, listened to my instructions regarding which tyres needed changing & changed them quickly & efficiently. Overall a very good experience which made getting new tyres for my car straight forward & convenient.\": [0,\n",

The price was a noticeable saving, and the pre-arranged fitting time meant I was expected at the garage reception. So far so good, with full marks to [REDACTED] at this point. My question from this point on is: how come it took the garage over an hour and a quarter to actually fit the tyres ? Ok, they were diligent enough to check all the wheels before they started, and reported unusual tyre wear on the fronts - for which we agreed to check the alignment. But the alignment check and adjustment was only carried out after the aforementioned 1.25hrs, and trhe end result was a 2 hour visit. For 2 tyres. On a prearranged 1/2 hr slot. With 5 days notice. This to me is unacceptable - some people also have jobs to go to, and I wasn't anticipating this chunk of time taken out of my working day.If Red Bull's F1 team can do it in 1.88 seconds with half a lap's notice , how come a major national chain can be as slovenly as this ? Not impressed. I will use [REDACTED] again, but not, to name names, ATS. (who originally wanted £26 more for exactly the same 2 tyres if bought via their own website).\": [1,\n",

I have had tyres fitted before only took around 30min. they were extremely busy. based on this I got a taxi to my brother's because what was I going to do for an hour and a half. I got a call at 11.47 from the tyre fitters asking me for my pin so that could start the electric engine in my car to move it. It had not been moved from where I parked it At 12.30 I decided to go back down to the tyre fitters they were still in the process of fitting my tyres. My car was blocked by another car that had no wheels on it. I the had to wait for these wheels to be fitted. I finally got away about 1.30pm. I had asked for the best of the 2 tyres to be put into my boot. so that I could keep it for emergency puncture replacement. I got home it was not there. I had to go back again and waste another 10-20 minutes while they looked for my tyre. It screwed up my day as I needed to do things/ shopping before we departed by car to France on Sunday morning.\": [0,\n",

Due to the delay we are no longer able to honor your scheduled appointment time, at this stage we would now be looking to reschedule your appointment from 02/08/2019 (Friday) onward to allow us time to rectify the delay and ensure your tyres are at the garage. Could you please advise a suitable time and date from 02/08/2019 (Friday) onward that I would be able to re-schedule your appointment to and I will action this with your chosen garage and send over an updated conformation email. You can either reply to this email or you can call us on 01721 540650. We are open until 5:30pm on weekdays, I appreciate that this is short notice however we have only just been made aware that the tyres have not been delivered and understand this is frustrating.

       " 'Not very interested. I have recently had tyres fitted at Tweeddale Motors in Peebles, my second visit through [REDACTED] and they are absolutely fantastic! Friendly efficient and a pleasure to deal with. The reason for the poor rating is this, before my first visit to Tweeddale Motors I had arranged for a fitting in Penicuik. I went to get the tyres fitted and was told that [REDACTED] customers must leave the car for four hours after which the tyres will have been fitted ready for collection. I was unable to do this and said that I would have to return another day. Looking at the [REDACTED] website it stated that a queuing process would be in operation at this location, so I arrived at opening time a couple of days later, only to be told to collect the car in four hours time. Given the absence of customers and the information on the website I explained that I was unhappy with the service being offered and was told that if I did not wish to fit in with their procedure they would return the tyres which I agreed would probably be for the best. I spoke to [REDACTED] about this and, while very sympathetic and offering a discount on the price, they expressed no interest in including the fitting procedures in Penicuik on their website and indeed to this day it appears unchanged. I felt like a second class customer for using [REDACTED] in Penicuik, if the conditions were made plain on the website, I would have been able to make a different choice. Worse was the fact that [REDACTED] customer relations were not interested in addressing what I think is a real issue.Incidentally I did not bother with the discount as I was delighted with the service I received in Peebles.': [1,\n",

However the issues I had with the garage (F1 Autocentres - Gloucester) after is the reason this gets a low star rating.I was originally booked in for a Saturday. I turn up, after getting a reminder of my booking via text I might add. The garage didn't have any fitters to do my tyres. They were sick. So I was a bit annoyed they couldn't have informed me before I left. But I don't blame them for people calling in sick. I was asked to come back on Sunday.So I turn up on Sunday @ 11am and since I didn't need the car I was happy to leave it there all day. Was told to come back at 4pm. I come back and they have not even started my car. I had to wait an hour for me car and the garage didn't do the tracking I had requested with it. The only positive, and why I gave 2 stars and not 1. Is they offered to do the tracking for free.Had to go back on Tuesday. I turn up on time as requested, but they are not ready, ask me to come back in 45 minutes. So I do that, have to wait around 30 minutes to get my car seen. At the end they only did the front tracking. So I had to go back again on Wednesday. This time I was seen within 20 minutes of arriving.But overall the service was not good. Having to go back 4 times just to have 2 tyres fitted and tracking. I will not be using that garage again.

Will use [REDACTED] for all my tyres from now on and I will recommend your service to anyone I know wanting new tyres. Thankyou.': [0,\n",

I spoke to Tony and considering it seemed quite a stressful time he remained really friendly, upbeat and willing to help. It took a little longer than an hour to change my two front tyres but as they were working on other cars and short staffed it was completely understandable. When I returned a week later to have the torque checked the same two employees were in the middle of changing the tyres on two other cars, they came right over and both quickly checked my tyres.

       " '[REDACTED] OK McConechys not OK. Ordered up my new tyres from [REDACTED] online, good price and good prompt service from [REDACTED]. However, I made a massive mistake in choosing McConechy\\'s, Sighthill, Edinburgh as the nominated tyre fitters. It is clear that as a [REDACTED] customer and not an actual McConechy\\'s customer appearing at their workplace wanting your tyres fitted, you are in actual fact an annoyance to them and you are getting in their way.McConechy\\'s fitted my tyres (although I\\'m very sure reluctantly).Upon being told by the tyre fitter that my car was now ready to go, I walked up to the car and noticed that there was no dustcaps fitted and had to request that 2 new dustcaps be fitted. I then left after being handed my tyre fitting paperwork.A day later I was checking the air pressures of my new tyres and then also noticed that McConechy\\'s had not even changed the valve stems either. I contacted McConechy\\'s about this and it was the tyre fitter that done the work that answered the phone. I told him that I noticed they had not changed the valve stems. I got this pathetic excuse about my existing valve stems being metal ones and he did not think I would have wanted rubber valve stems fitted, so he did not bother to change them and as an afterthought he stated \"but I changed the valve cores though\".I don\\'t believe a word of that, what the tyre fitter guy doesn\\'t know, is that I\\'m a fully qualified engineer and I know corner cutting when I see it. Remember I had to actually request that they fit dustcaps. Unfortunately I didn\\'t notice McConechy\\'s had not changed the valve stems at that time or I would have pulled them up right there and then.I know why he didn\\'t change the valve stems, it is because they are all rusted up, badly corroded and might take a bit longer to remove and change over, maybe even some other problems that\\'s why they were not changed and not his BS story about them being metal.I paid for 2 new tyres fitted and balanced with new valve stems and new valves fitted. That is not what I got.I got 2 new tyres fitted and balanced without new valve stems and a story that I don\\'t believe about the valve cores being changed.But that makes it OK doesn\\'t it ? NO, it certainly doesn\\'t !I was also supposed to have a free wheel alignment check done, the McConechy\\'s fitter never made any mention of this. I had already decided not to go ahead with the alignment check anyway.Also states on the tyre fitting paperwork that the wheel nuts were torqued to 110nm. Well when I checked them 50 miles later, the wheel nuts were all at very different torque levels, the locking wheel nuts being the tightest by far.I do not believe for 1 second that the wheels were even torqued in the first place, more like slammed back on and racked up with the air gun. There is no way the wheel nuts seen a torque wrench. The McConechy\\'s tyre fitter was/is a story telling corner cutter. Avoid them, you are not a McConechy\\'s customer, you are an annoyance to them, you are getting in their way. Not at all happy with any of this.Steven Dryden.': [1,\n",

I had to phone [REDACTED] as I had already made arrangements and taken time off work to have the fitting on Friday. I am reliant on my vehicle for transport to work and of course this meant that I would be without a vehicle for another 4 days!. [REDACTED] were unable to keep the Friday booking and I was offered a small compensation by the rep on the phone. I kept the booking on Tuesday as the tyre which I ordered was only available through [REDACTED]. Come Tuesday there was no further problems the garage I chose was spot on. I awaited the compensation to be refunded back. Another week goes by and there was no sign of any compensation or any communication. So I rang [REDACTED] who told me there was no note on their system regarding me being given any compo.This was sorted the following day and I did receive the amount promised.Overall I would say this was a rough ride ordering from [REDACTED]. It's a shame they are failing at such little things and leave you stranded. The whole point of ordering a tyre from the internet is so that it is convenient and reliable.

Booking 4 new tyres for my Audi Q3 was easy and booked a time slot at their ‘recommended’ garage, so far so good.So turned up 15 mins before the due time as requested and walked in only to be greeted with “the car wash is outside”, after pointing out I was there for 4 new tyres was told “oh sorry” and asked for my name then to be told they were busy so there might be a delay. So not the greeting I would have expected and why give a time slot then not adhere to it?Anyway there were two other customers in front of me in the waiting room when the manager came out and told them both exactly the same thing, their tracking was out but it can be rectified for a special price of £38 (approx as can’t remember exactly). After the other customers had left the manager came out and gave me exactly the same pitch about the tracking, and the special price of £38 (I check my tyres regularly and had not seen any signs of uneven wear) so declined ......... call me a cynic but 3 people in a row all with exactly the same pitch about tracking? Seems unlikely to me and a way of getting another £38 out of people.So after approx 1hr 15 mins I left the garage all completed and apart from the above all seemed ok.Not using the car that much due to a few days off it was parked up. 4 days & less that 75 miles later I got a tyre presser alert and on checking found all the tyres had been over inflated 42psi instead of 36psi.Moving on to 6 days later and around 150 miles later noticed that the F/N/S wheel has a nut missing, the locking wheel nut was gone so checked the others & found the F/O/S wheel had 2 x nut covers missing and the locking nut was loose and could be turned with your fingers.I immediately went to the garage and to be fare they ordered a replacement set of locking nuts without much quibbling and 90 mins later went back for them to be replaced BUT as they were a patterned replacement the nut covers did not fit so now I have the 4 locking wheel nuts without covers and one of the standard nuts without a cover. The managed did say he would order a replacement set and then get them to fit but why should I settle for second bast. My car was in purse to condition when I went in for the tyres and due to their error has left me with non standard locking wheel nuts and covers missing - not happy!!Overall the whole experience with this garage is poor to say the least and I would never use them again.

After 10 minutes of waiting I asked what was happening and they said they werent too sure as it was nothing to do with them because I bought through [REDACTED]. They then decided it was time to take my vehicle into the workshop and eventually after 50 minutes the job was done. I do not excpect to wait 50 minutes for 2 tyres to be replaced. Unfortunately they have let you down and would make me think twice about using you again. Id rather pay a few quid extra and have a quicker turn around at my normal garage.': [0,\n",

I reached out to [REDACTED] and they quickly put me in touch with the fitters and they had someone out the very next morning to replace them. It was an issue with the valves and they fitted new tyres. [REDACTED] followed up to make sure everything had been sorted. Whilst I obviously would have prefered that the tyres had not been defective, I think the best measure of a company is how they handle it when something goes wrong. I've used them twice now and I was thoroughly impressed with how quickly they got the problem sorted. I highly recommend them.\": [1,\n",

My gripe though concerns the fact that having ordered and paid online for 5 tyres for my Land-rover, when the day came for them to be fitted I had rung up the previous afternoon to be told they didn’t have the tyres so the fitting wouldn’t take place. As it was a home fitting I’d taken the day off!!!!I was then told they could get four of the tyres for me by the following Tuesday and the fifth by the Friday. Great thought I.Well, I got my four tyres fitted on the Tuesday. No problem.Thursday afternoon came at at about 5.30pm I got an email from BC stating they couldn’t get my 5th tyre and “how did I want to proceed”.Livid???? Just a tad.I called BC but by then they’d closed for the day, so rang first thing the next day. Very helpful and polite lady understood my frustrations but went on to tell me that the tyre I’d ordered, paid for and expected to be fitted that morning couldn’t be obtained and BC didn’t know when they’d get some in. Great!!!Bottom line is a tyre was sourced (in Spain), and was eventually fitted the following Wednesday. Three weeks this took to complete.My advice would be make sure BC either have or can immediately source the tyres you’ after before committing to the deal.': [1,\n",

Finding and paying for the tires online, including the actual price for high grade Michelins, was all very good...things just fell apart after choosing the deliver and fit option to a local (big name) garage. Using the online booking too was a doddle but within 24hrs I had an email saying the time was no longer any good as the garage was fully booked. Then the customer service for alternative provision was basically picked for me from a few days/times I offered (a week later than my original slot mind you!). The worst part however was taking time of work to visit the garage only to be told 'they don't book tire fitting at their garage' and basically being told to wait in line for 45 mins behind the drive-in customers?! Bit pointless having a booking system and they fully blamed [REDACTED] for offering something online that well basically, wasn't offered in the real world. I have to say on the garage's part though they were excellent when I returned after about 40 mins and did the 2x tires very quickly and capably, so the eventual service was great.

Overall, I'm really chuffed with the product (4 x Michelin Pilot Sport 4's) and the job the premier partner (Strathclyde Autotune) carried out.However, the customer service experience at [REDACTED] left a lot to be desired after it came to light I was consistently given incorrect information by email, and later on the phone.To cut a long story short, [REDACTED] appear to book jobs and services for you on their own system without consulting the garage you choose and their schedule for that given day.I booked a tyre fitting for 4 new tyres and selected some additional services.I was never given an appointment time. Similarly, the services I selected were split across a Friday and a Monday.Not the end of the world..but the tyre fitting was scheduled for Friday and TPMS Sensor Valve Replacement was scheduled for the Monday.For me it made more sense to fit the sensors on Friday whilst the wheels are already coming off to fit the tyres?Anyway, I phoned to challenge this aspect and to double check why I wasn't given an appointment time.I was told adamantly that the garage operated on a first-come-first-serve basis and that they couldn't provide the additional services I asked for.I struggled to see the value in this system over scheduled appointments; but I went along with it as I had already paid for the tyres.Cut To: Me the next day getting up super early to be the first person in this first-come-first-serve queue.After arriving at the garage before the staff, I thought it was odd that no other people were rushing to get there first?Turns out that the garage has an appointment book, and [REDACTED] tell you it's first-come-first-serve, and split your services across a weekend for no other reason than to cause total inconvenience?The garage was great though!..

My problems started when the partner garage (Auto Pfect at Wath on Dearne) could not accommodate me on the date I booked on line and I therefore had to rearrange it and wait a further week as it needed to be a weekend. The tyres seemed to be fitted fine but I had to ask them to find my locking wheel nut key as it was not in the car. A few days later I took my car to the Kia dealership for mot and service. The car failed because the tyre on the rear drivers side had been fitted the wrong way round!! Apparently the tyres are directional. Kia sorted out the tyre for a cost and passed the car and the garage who fitted the tyres reimbursed me for that cost. I chose Auto Pfect because [REDACTED] rated them as a premium fitter, and despite the staff being friendly and generally helpful, the mistakes made were very basic and avoidable for a professional tyre fitting garage. I certainly wouldn't trust them to provide other services and will stick to the trusted main Kia dealer.\": [1,\n",

       " \"I ordered a Dunlop SP Sport Maxx 255/45 R17 W (98) tyre for my Mercedes on the [REDACTED] website. As usual, I took a screen-shot of the 'Order confirmation' screen showing these details for my records. Shortly afterwards I received an email confirmation from [REDACTED] which indicated that I had ordered a BMW Run-flat version of the Dunlop SP Sport Maxx. I rang to query this and although the sales person was very pleasant he seemed unable to accept that I had not ordered the BMW Run-flat version. Even after I emailed a copy of my screen-shot and then cancelled the order he still insisted that their ordering screen and systems are quite clear and that I must have accidentally ordered the wrong tyre. (Sub-text; another stupid customer!)I have since re-run my attempt to order this tyre and I suggest that [REDACTED] may benefit from re-designing their ordering screen and de-bugging their 'Order Confirmation' screen. After you enter a tyre number (AND the vehicle that the tyre is for!), the order-screen offers a number of boxes in rows of three which feature various brands of that tyre size. The large, headline text of these boxes are the brand and the price then the classified name of the tyre (in my case 'Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT' followed by some generic (and therefore worthless) 4 and 5-star reviews. Between the 5-star review and the price is a narrow ruled-off area with one or more unexplained icons and logos. All the offered brands seem to have a tiny black car icon, presumably to indicate to the totally confused among us that the tyres are for a car rather than a bicycle or an airplane. Some of the tyres then have various car logos - BMW, Mercedes, Ferrari etc as well as 'Run Flat', and MO. There is no explanation as to whether there is something special about the Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT tyre with a BMW logo that makes it only suitable for a BMW, and how can that be anyway? And if it is, why do they offer it in response to an inquiry for a Mercedes tyre, which is one of the compulsory fields in the ordering screen? And if these symbols are critical to the correct ordering of a tyre specific to a particular vehicle then wouldn't it be sensible for them to be much larger and with their relevance explained?Then, having allowed customers to order a tyre specific to a particular vehicle, why doesn't the 'Order confirmation' screen include that fact? If I hadn't checked the confirmation email carefully I could have easily ended up with the wrong tyre on my car.So, if [REDACTED] want me to try them again they need to let me know that they have either amended these issues or explained why they don't need to.\": [0,\n",

I’d had Bridgestones on my summer wheels for over 40,000 miles on the rears. I’ve been running Winter Wheels and tyres and when I had to get my summer wheels back on and the rears replaced, I tried [REDACTED] (BC). Having bought tyres online for the last 3 sets of tyres, I found BC to be the cheapest available for what is quite an unusual size. Add to this there was a 10% off flash sale that day and the price was considerably cheaper than TyreLeader. The wheels and tyres were fitted by a local tyre dealer I know. Unfortunately when I got home, I realised that one of the tyres was not a Mercedes Only(MO) tyre. The difference between the standard tyre and the MO is that the MO tyre has a significant 2cm flange that protects my lovely AMG 19in rims. I often say that you only know what a company is like until there is a problem. The resolution of the problem is the mark of how good the company is. BC went above and beyond:I contacted BC and they were fantastic. As I work in London, and I’m busy at the moment, it took me a little while to get round to taking photos for BC’s reference. However, despite having travelled over 700 miles since fitting, BC have arranged for the tyre to be replaced with the correct one. Additionally, BC gave me a generous goodwill gesture as recognition of my inconvenience. I will not only buy all my future tyres from them, but I will also highly recommend them to my family and friends. If all companies treated their customers with the efficiency, courtesy and genuine desire to provide a good service, as BC do, the world would be a better place!

I went back to the car to show him where it was, he stated that he didn’t have time to rummage through people’s stuff. I submit that if he’d shown up on time he’d have had an extra 10-15 minutes to rummage through my stuff.

Received confirmation email but didn’t contain a time slot. Chased this up with them and reply said AM before midday. Day before I got an email around 5pm to advise they can’t fulfil my order and they’ve cancelled my booking with garage. Attempted to move it to another date that I couldn’t attend due to work. Told them to cancel and requested a refund. Next day (original day of garage booking), I received a text / email advising tires have now arrived at garage and that I can call along to get them fitted. Arrived at garage who informed me tires had been there for three days! Very very poor customer service, messed me about and made me late for work. If it wasn’t for the discount provided via Direct Line I wouldn’t have used this company and doubt I will in future.': [0,\n",

This was my 1st experience in buying tyres online and I have to say I'm totally pleased that I chose [REDACTED].The process of comparing, choosing and reading up about the tyres in my size and price range is very helpful and simple to do. They have several top Brands and a large overall choice.And that also goes for choosing the garage and appointment time/date that suits me.You chose the garage and your chosen tyres will be there waiting for you when you arrive. Supply them the order number and abit of information like which tyres you want replacing etc and then sit back and they'll deal with everything. You can leave a review of the garage afterwards to help others decide.You can even copy the appointment info straight into the calendar which is a nice touch. The app links to mapping services to direct you to the garage.If the garage offers other services you can order these aswell, but if there's a charge then you will have to pay that direct to the garage while there.The customer service is 1st class over the phone and in web chat forms.The phone app was recommended to me and I'll certainly be recommending it to other people I know who can benefit from the service.Prices are competitive and I found them to be cheaper than the majority of the market and knowing that the price I pay includes fitting and VAT means I don't need to separately pay the garage aswell.If you don't require fitting then for a reduced price they will deliver the tyres straight to an alternative address.If you need to cancel your order for any reason then they don't question it or try to convince you not to. They simply issue a full refund. No pressure at all. Easy.My experience with [REDACTED] was excellent. I will be using the service next time I require tyre services.Takes the worry out of searching, buying and arranging fittings!\": [1,\n",
